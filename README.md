## rust-browser
This is a simple web browser written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) `1.18.x`.

The intention is NOT to closely follow standards, be suitable for everyday use, or be security-oriented. 
Instead, this is merely a pet project for me to better understand web browsers and the rust language.

Aditionally, it will also implement ideas I'd like to see in other browsers.

## Roadmap
Alpha `v0.1.x`:
 * Very basic UI, without tabs
 * Supported protocols: HTTP and HTTPS
 * Supported MIME types: text/plain
 * Supported charsets and encoding: ASCII only
 * Javascript support: no
 * CSS3 support: partial (`color`, `display`, `width`, `height`, `background-color`, `padding`, `margin`, `border`)
 * HTML5 support: partial (`div`, `p`, `span`, `input`, `form`, `noscript`, `a`, `h1 to h6`, `hr`, `br`)
 
 Alpha `v0.2.x`:
  * TODO
